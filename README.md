# MySQL Access
The MySQLAccess module is largely inspired by no-sql database access 
libraries used in front-end Javascript projects, such as AngularFire 
and VueFire. It's built as a form of wrapper around the native Java JDBC
framework, with the intention of creating an even more abstract and simplified
way of accessing MySQL databases.
